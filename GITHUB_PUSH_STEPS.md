# üöÄ Push to GitHub - Step by Step Guide

## Your project is ready! Follow these steps to push to GitHub:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right ‚Üí "New repository"
3. Repository name: `uk-government-services` (or your preferred name)
4. Description: `Complete UK Government Services Portal with MP search, postcode mapping, and real government data`
5. Make it **Public** (to showcase your work)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository
Copy the repository URL from GitHub (it will look like: `https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/uk-government-services.git`)

Then run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/uk-government-services.git

# Push your code with LFS support
git push -u origin master
```

### Step 3: What Will Happen
- Git LFS will upload all large JSON files to GitHub's LFS storage
- Your complete project will be pushed to GitHub
- All 558 MPs, 570+ postcode mappings, and test files will be included
- GitHub will show your professional README.md as the project description

### Step 4: Verify Success
After pushing, visit your GitHub repository page. You should see:
- ‚úÖ All your files and folders
- ‚úÖ Professional README.md displayed
- ‚úÖ Large JSON files marked with "LFS" badges
- ‚úÖ Complete project ready to showcase

## üéâ Current Status
- ‚úÖ Git repository initialized
- ‚úÖ All files committed with LFS tracking
- ‚úÖ Large files properly handled by Git LFS
- ‚úÖ Professional documentation ready
- ‚úÖ Ready to push to GitHub!

## üîß If You Encounter Issues

### Large File Errors
If you get any "large file" errors, they should be resolved by LFS. If not, run:
```bash
git lfs track "*.json"
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Add LFS tracking"
```

### Authentication
If prompted for GitHub username/password:
- Use your GitHub username
- For password, use a Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)
- Generate token at: GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens
